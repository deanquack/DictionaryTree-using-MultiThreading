# DictionaryTree-using-MultiThreading
# Multithreading using POSIX Threads (February 2022 - March 2022): This assignment was designed similarly to the Dictionary Tree Assignment but this includes the POSIX Library and the UNISTD Library which gives the ability to use multiple pthrreads to execute our functions and getopt which includes our optional arguments we used for this program. This contains the same style to approaching the program instead we split the word counting and add/populate functions in separate files. 
# THIS PROGRAM WAS DONE USING C/C++, RED HAT LINUX OS PROVIDED BY SDSU, AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE.
# posix_add: inserts characters/words into the tree using a while loop that parses the words of the dictionary using the delimiters and puts it into the tree data structure.
# posix_count: searches for the word using a binary search method and then increments a count for every word that is found within the tree data structure and prints it to a textfile output.
